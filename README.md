ffplayout-frontend
=====

This web GUI is for managing [ffplayout](https://github.com/ffplayout/ffplayout).

**The Interface is mostly made for 24/7 streaming.** Other scenarios like streaming in folder mode or playlists with no starting time will work, but is not shown correctly.

For a better understanding about the functionality, take a look to the screenshots below.

Read [install.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for manual installation.

After installations you have to setup ssl for your **https** connections.
