# Run ffplayout in container


## Base Image

Use of [CentOS image](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos) as base image as it offer the possibility to use systemd.
In order to run systemd in a container it has to run in privileged mode and bind to the `cgroup` of the host.

## Image

In addition to the base image, there is the compilation of ffmpeg and all lib from source based on https://github.com/jrottenberg/ffmpeg.
We can't use directly the image from `jrottenberg/ffmpeg` as it compile ffmpeg with the flag `--enable-small` that remove some part of the json from the ffprobe command.

The image is build with a default user/pass `admin/admin`.

You can take a look Ã  the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

### /!\ as ffmpeg is compiled with `--enable-nonfree` don't push it to a public registry nor distribute the image /!\

## Storage

There are some folders/files that are important for ffplayout to work well such as :
 - /usr/share/ffplayout/db => where all the data for the `ffpapi` are stored (user/pass etc)
 - /var/lib/ffplayout/tv-media => where the media are stored by default (configurable)
 - /var/lib/ffplayout/playlists => where playlists are stored (configurable)
 - /etc/ffplayout/ffplayout.yml => the core config file

It may be useful to create/link volume for those folders/files.

## Docker

How to build the image:\
```BASH
# build default
docker build -t ffplayout-image .

# build ffmpeg from source
docker build -f fromSource.Dockerfile -t ffplayout-image:from-source .

# build with current almalinux image
docker build -f Almalinux.Dockerfile -t ffplayout-image:almalinux .
```

example of command to start the container:

`docker run -ti -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --cap-add SYS_ADMIN -p 8787:8787 ffplayout-image`

Note from CentOS docker hub page
`
There have been reports that if you're using an Ubuntu host, you will need to add -v /tmp/$(mktemp -d):/run in addition to the cgroups mount.
`

## Kubernetes

basic example to run the service in k8s:
```
